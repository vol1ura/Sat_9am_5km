      description: S95 is a platform that unites independent park runs conducted according to the main principles of parkrun suspended in Russia (Saturday, 9 AM, 5 km).
      paragraphs:
        - "Imagine: Saturday, 9 AM. The sun is just starting to warm up, birds are singing, and you... you're already at the start of a 5-kilometer distance. But this isn't just a run — it's S95, a platform that unites everyone who loves running, fresh air, and good company."
        - "Many have already fallen in love with parkruns as events where runners and volunteers start each Saturday with movement, communication, and a cup of tea from a thermos. But times change, and traditions remain. Now there's S95 — it's a whole community. Here you can find out where the nearest run is, what volunteers are needed for the upcoming Saturday, check your results (and proudly brag if you've beaten your personal record), and find like-minded people who also believe that Saturday morning is time not for sleep, but for running and communication."
        - "And most importantly — S95 is accessible to everyone. It doesn't matter who you are: a marathoner with a hundred medals or someone who last ran in school PE class. There's no participation fee here, only payment in the form of good mood and smiles. You can walk or run the distance at your comfortable pace."
        - "So, if you're not yet in the know, S95 isn't just a set of symbols, it's a lifestyle, a Saturday ritual, and an opportunity to start the day with something really cool. Grab your sneakers, call your friends, and join the runs where every kilometer is a step toward new acquaintances, adventures, or a cool photo for social media."

      faq: Frequently Asked Questions
      about_markers:
        question: Will there be any directions or markers on the route?
        answer: The course is well marked with orange cones, there's a marshal at the turnaround (if there is one), and you'll likely be running surrounded by other participants.
      about_registering:
        question: Do I need to register to participate in a run?
        answer_html: "Not required, but it's recommended to register using our Telegram bot <a href=\"%{link}\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">%{bot_nick}</a>. As a result, you'll have a personal barcode that you'll show to the volunteer. Additionally, the bot will send notifications with run results."
      about_participation:
        question: 'Can I just come at 8:45 to run together?'
        answer: "Yes, you can just come and run. Registration is needed so you have a result in the protocol. Register once and you can come to any run. If you don't register - you'll be in the protocol as \"Unknown\". On site, they'll help you register and enjoy five kilometers in good company."
      about_barcode:
        question: Can I use a parkrun (5 versts, RunPark) barcode?
        answer: Yes, you can come to a run with another system's barcode. However, your result will only be counted in the S95 system.
      about_things:
        question: Where can I leave my things during the run?
        answer: Usually, everyone leaves their things on benches near the start and finish area.
      personal_info:
        question: I accidentally made a mistake in my name during registration. How to fix it?
        answer_html: Go to the <a href="/user">Settings</a> section (login and password may be required) and make the necessary changes.

      title: Want to Start S95 in Your Park?
      description: We tell you how to start conducting S95 events in your favorite park.
      body_html: >
        <p>This section is for those ready to turn their favorite park into a place where running enthusiasts and good mood gather every Saturday.</p>

        <h3>Why S95?</h3>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>We're an international community: S95 runs take place in Russia, Belarus, and Serbia, and all results are collected in a unified system</li>
            <li>We have a motivating badge and challenge system — get achievements not only for high results, but also just for participation and personal progress</li>
            <li>Our platform isn't just about running, but also about communication and social mission: we actively develop volunteering, communicate, find new friends</li>
            <li>Simple and fast registration of new participants via Telegram bot, all data always at hand</li>
            <li>We use modern technologies and approaches: lots of various statistics and rankings, ability to add friends and see who's going to which run</li>
            <li>We have our own unique mobile app for conducting runs</li>
            <li>Our system is completely open and uses OpenSource technologies — everyone can suggest improvements and make the platform even better</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <h3>Action Plan</h3>
        <p>Before submitting an application, check the <a href="/events">Our Events</a> section — there might already be our runs near you. In that case, join the local team and help develop the running community in your area.</p>
        <p>
          If there are no S95 runs nearby, and you're eager to become a pioneer of the movement, you'll need:
          <ul>
            <li>a safe and convenient course (without intersections with roads and dangerous sections)</li>
            <li>a team of enthusiasts ready to wake up on Saturdays before the alarm</li>
            <li>some organizational skills and lots of love for running</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>From the moment of application to the first technical start, some time may pass, but the S95 team will do everything possible so your park fills with Saturday running spirit as soon as possible!</p>
        <p>Ready to become part of a movement that changes Saturday mornings for the better? Write to us at <a href="mailto:%{info_email}" target="_blank" title="Send us email">%{info_email}</a> with the subject "Start S95" and let's create new running traditions together!</p>

        content:
          4029: My journey in S95 — a road from angry denial of running to first sports victories and self-realization in organizing. A new best life with the support of a big caring family. More than Saturdays. More than running.
          6901: For me, our running community is more than just running! It's a healthy atmosphere and support among completely different people united by one movement. And a great bonus in the form of a cool side effect — good health, cheerful spirit, and a toned body!
          14500: Once, running along Pechatniki Embankment, I heard the call "run with us". I came a week later and my Saturday mornings were captured by regular starts and volunteering. Insanely happy that I found a running company that I so lacked.
          14089: One Saturday I came to the park in the morning, learning about the runs from a poster on a stand. The second time I came back to volunteer and run, and the next one — brought my son. And it all got so addictive that it hasn't "let go" of both of us to this day)
          7736: This is no longer just a community, not just Saturday - it's huge positive energy from people who meet to run 5 km together. During this run we learn all the news about each other, celebrate birthdays, plan the running year. I started running 4 years ago, didn't do any sports in my youth. It all started with a good doctor who after surgery didn't forbid, but advised running. It seems, that was my point from which I plunged into the running community and met wonderful people. Very soon I'll be celebrating my 100th Saturday run and, you know what that means?! It's AMAZING. Don't believe it? Come!

        Hello, %{first_name}.

        It seems there were several profiles in our database belonging to you (for example, you might have been entered manually at some point). The bot merged them into one automatically and your data might have been slightly updated.

        Please check the data correctness and _update your QR code_ using the /qrcode command

        *Parkrun ID:* %{parkrun_code}
        *5 versts ID:* %{fiveverst_code}
        *RunPark ID:* %{runpark_code}

        If you find inaccuracies, report this to the volunteers of your run or write to @vol1ura
    volunteer_info: |
      %{first_name}, good evening!

      Attention!
      Scanner data contains errors, so result *%{position}* cannot be saved.
      Please check position *%{position}*, as well as participant with ID *%{code}* for duplication in the protocol and scanner files.

      *Attention!* Activity ID=%{activity_id} (%{activity_date}) has running volunteer *%{athlete_name}* (ID=%{athlete_code})
